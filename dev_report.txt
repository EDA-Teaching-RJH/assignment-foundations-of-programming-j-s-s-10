1. Legacy Code Post-Mortem:
- Commit 091e47f8e23f68799ead7a4fc86434dcc8d630f5 - The code 'if opt = "1":' raises a SyntaxError because the '=' operator is for variable assignment, not comparison.
- Commit 4833b1321adcee99611f1303fb817edf2ccc00a5 - The function 'run_system_monolith' was not called correctly at the end of the program, there were no parentheses at the end of it.
- Commit 2920029066abbb34b126fd4746bf1baece61ae50 - The 'loading' variable was never increased to 5, causing an infinite loop, so I added 'loading += 1'.
- Commit 57a18b4552239b60f31881a3b2d904142cd6570a - 'i' was set to 'range(10)' rather than the number of crew members, causing it to index the lists out of range.
- Commit 620dce19e995939a48f4108b204db80a667bc2e3 - When adding a new crew member, only the name was added to 'n', not the rank and division to their respective lists.
- Commit e1e1832ebef2e129fe3532c57da841b92b075b0c - On line 62 (as of this commit), the integer 'count' was concatenated to a string, which is impossible, so I encased it in 'str' function.
- Commit 8da55b148f1c3bcc4fce5331729160948453bd1f - On line 60 (as of this commit), the condition 'rank == "Captain" or "Commander"' always evaluates to True, as "Commander" always evaluates to true, so I added 'rank == ' before it.
- Commit 548256d6a614094753ad69703c955181132025f3 - When removing crew member, ValueError raised by 'n.index(rem)' when invalid name entered. Fixed with try-except-else statement.
- Commit ef97806e81425b0fd72ea01980b329a5f96d4ac0 - The fuel functionality was broken, 'fuel' and 'consumption' were assigned in each loop of the main 'while True' loop and additionally, nothing decremented the fuel by the consumption. I added a line to do that in each loop and moved the assignments to before the loop.
- Commit 73b8f44899b9b02e6d4f0fb05be6762a12f7b8e3 - The variable 'x' was ineffective. First, it was assigned in each loop of the main 'while True' loop, so I moved its assignment to before it. Secondly, the 'while fuel > 0' loop was null, it just breaks after one iteration, so I changed it to an if statement and removed the break. Then, I added an else statement to this to change x to 0, so that in its if statement, the condition wouldn't be met and the 'else' block would be executed and 'System Failure' would occur. I also added a 'break' to this to end the program upon system failure. I don't know if this is the intended functionality of 'x', but I took my best guess.

2. Parallel List Strategy:
The parallel list strategy is dangerous because everything that happens to one list must happen to the others; every time an entry is removed from one list, the corresponding entries must be removed from the others, same with adding to them, and the indeces must line up, i.e. the data at index 0 must correspond to the data in every other list at index 0. If ever this is not the case, there is an desynchronisation and the parallel lists are effectively useless.
This can be prevented by implementing functions to append and remove from parallel lists while maintaining synchronisation, and then only using these functions to modify said lists. You could go one step further and encapsulate the lists and their methods within classes.
